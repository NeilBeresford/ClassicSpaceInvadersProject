 TManager is a template manager that controls the addition, removal and update/draws etc
 Managers are devired by the Template Manager - that uses GameObject therefore all
 objects that will use a manager must have a GameObject as a base.


 [First set of notes]
 
 What is a sprite?

 An object that can be displayed on the screen. 
 ( X,Y scale, rotation, origin, colour, sourceRectangle )
 
 An object that can be controlled on the screen. 
 ( Update function to allow for logic, ie movement and collision checks)

 What can a sprite do?

 What ever you code it to do! It will need some AI or game logic.
 It must be able to be cleanly removed. Sound and possible player input
 will be needed.
